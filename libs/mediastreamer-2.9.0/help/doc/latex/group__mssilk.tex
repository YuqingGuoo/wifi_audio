SILK Speech Codec (draft-\/vos-\/silk-\/02) plugins filters to encode and decode audio.  
SILK Speech Codec (draft-\/vos-\/silk-\/02) plugins filters to encode and decode audio. {\bfseries MSSILKEnc} and {\bfseries MSSILKDec} are 2 Mediastremer2's filters available to encode/decode speech using SILK sdk from Skype. This integration leverage on source code from: {\tt http://developer.skype.com/silk.} Note that usage of this plugin is subject to license from Skype. \par

 {\bfseries  Supported SILK features} \par
 SILK is a multi rate, multi sampling frequency codec with variable packetization time. SILK allows control of these parameters using standard Mediastreamer2 functions. \par
\par
 {\bfseries  init} \par
 mssilk is automatically loaded by Medistreamer2 in case libmssilk.so is present in the Mediastremer2 plugin directory. Alternatively it is possible to load it by calling the function 
\begin{DoxyCode}
 void libmssilk_init() 
\end{DoxyCode}
 Very usefull for Android or IOS. \par
\par
 {\bfseries  MSSILKEnc} \par
 MSSILKEnc is a filter from category \doxyref{MS\_\-FILTER\_\-ENCODER}{p.}{group__mediastreamer2__filter_ggad5279a551f5f10f3b80887f19b345101a77401d653240a6f21afb6b98dddd0604}. It has its {\bfseries enc\_\-fmt} value set to {\bfseries \char`\"{}SILK\char`\"{}}.The following key control functions are implemented: \par
 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries \doxyref{MS\_\-FILTER\_\-SET\_\-SAMPLE\_\-RATE}{p.}{group__mediastreamer2__filter_ga72923806f1bca717d45e9b96423f1ca8}} Set both the output and input sampling rate. This value is internally mapped to both maximum codec sampling rate and API sampling rate. Supported value are 8000, 12000, 16000 and 24000. This value can be changed at any time. 
\item {\bfseries \doxyref{MS\_\-FILTER\_\-SET\_\-BITRATE}{p.}{group__mediastreamer2__filter_gad2b1e2f40765ba33021479cf74552a5c}} Set the target network output bitrate for this filter. As this value takes into account RTP/UDP/IP overhead, this filter first computes a codec bitrate from both this input and current packetization time value (I.E ptime). Computed codec bitrate value is passed to the SILK encoder as target bitrate. This value can be changed at any time. 
\item {\bfseries \doxyref{MS\_\-FILTER\_\-ADD\_\-FMTP}{p.}{group__mediastreamer2__filter_ga388f3fb78097eace39ee777a6814c2db}} Set codec specific parameter as described in draft-\/vos-\/silk-\/02. Default values are those proposed by draft-\/vos-\/silk-\/02. Supported parameters are {\bfseries maxptime}, {\bfseries ptime}, {\bfseries useinbandfec}. 
\end{DoxyItemize}\par
 Preset SILK encoder's values not configurable are: encoder {\bfseries complexity} set to 1, {\bfseries packetLossPercentage} set to 10 and {\bfseries useDTX} set to 0. \par
\par
 {\bfseries  MSSILDec} \par
 MSSILDec is a filter from category \doxyref{MS\_\-FILTER\_\-DECODER}{p.}{group__mediastreamer2__filter_ggad5279a551f5f10f3b80887f19b345101a113bbb21c331c2eb2174165bf0135ca6}. It has its {\bfseries enc\_\-fmt} value set to {\bfseries \char`\"{}SILK\char`\"{}}.This filter make use of SILK's builtin Packet Lose Concealment and Forward Error Correction feature.The following key control functions are implemented: \par
 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries \doxyref{MS\_\-FILTER\_\-SET\_\-SAMPLE\_\-RATE}{p.}{group__mediastreamer2__filter_ga72923806f1bca717d45e9b96423f1ca8}} Set output sampling rate. This value is internally mapped to API sampling rate.Supported value are 8000, 12000, 16000, 24000, 32000, 44000 and 48000. This value can be changed at any time.
